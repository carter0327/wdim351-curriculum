Homework Response 

I looked at the slideshow about how to stay current in the web design industry. So far in my academic career
 for web design, I haven't paid much atttention to outside sources for inspiration. I didn't even know they 
 really exisited. But after looking at this slide show I saw some awesome references that will definitely 
 help me stay current and and in the know. The information and ideas in the slideshow made the task of 
 getting somewhat caught up on some new trends a very doable task.
